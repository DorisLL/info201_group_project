We used a "Crime Data" dataset, which includes crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, downloaded from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-76bd0?fbclid=IwAR34NWjPQ1rvBMGHJqf21mUXiI35vi7ul8zNjMGkmAekaRXyxx-LYgQ7A_c). The dataset is provided by the Seattle Police Department with reports around the Seattle area and is updated daily.

Students and homeowners who primarily work/study in or inhabit the Seattle Area are our target audience. For the use of this project, we will hone in on homeowners in the Seattle Area and they will be more prone to and around crimes and will need to take action when such events happen.

Based on these questions:

* What are the occurrences of each type of crime in each neighborhood?
* What is the trend of the crime trend in each neighborhood?

we created some interactive graphs. For the first graph, the audience can learn the occurrences of each type of crime in a selected neighborhood of their choices. For the second graph, the audience can see a trend of a selected crime in a particular neighborhood, during a selected time range.
